# opengine-ai

A GOAP library for Java.

## What Is Goap?
GOAP is an AI system that attempts to solve the problem of exploding connections in traditional state machines or behavior trees. It does this by generating the connections between states automatically and having the developer define Goals and Behaviors instead.

## Tutorial

### Introduction
In this tutorial we are going to be designing a very simple shooter-type game. It will not be functional when we are done -- the entire thing will be psuedo-code to demonstrate ideas. At a later date, when opengine-ai is released, it will be updated with a runnable demo.

### Behaviors

#### Take Cover
#### Shoot
#### Look For Gun
#### Look For Enemy
#### Protect Point

### Goals
#### Stay Safe
#### Kill Enemy
#### Protect Point
